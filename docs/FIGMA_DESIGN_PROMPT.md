## Design Requirements

### Visual Style
- **Theme**: Light, clean, modern
- **Background**: White to light gray/blue gradient
- **Cards**: White with subtle shadows, rounded corners
- **Typography**: Clean, professional, easy to read
- **Spacing**: Generous whitespace, not cluttered
- **Icons**: Modern, consistent style (can be line icons or filled)

### Color Guidelines
- **Primary**: Blue (#2563eb or similar) to Cyan (#06b6d4 or similar) gradients

- **Accents**: Blue/cyan for CTAs and highlights

### Interactive Elements
- Buttons should have hover states (slight scale, shadow change, color shift)
- Cards should have subtle hover effects
- Smooth transitions and animations (can be noted in design specs)

### Responsive Considerations
- Design should work on desktop (primary focus)
- Consider mobile layout (stacked cards, adjusted spacing)
- Grid layouts should be responsive (4 columns → 2 columns → 1 column)

## Design Inspiration
- Modern SaaS landing pages (Stripe, Linear, Vercel)
- Healthcare/medical software (SimplePractice, TherapyNotes - but more modern)
- AI/tech product pages (clean, gradient accents, professional)
- Avoid: Overly clinical/medical aesthetic, dark themes, cluttered layouts

## Deliverables Needed
1. **Desktop Design** (1920px or 1440px width)
2. **Component Specifications**:
   - Button styles (primary, secondary, outline)
   - Card styles
   - Typography scale
   - Color palette with hex codes
   - Spacing system
3. **Optional**: Mobile layout (375px width)
4. **Optional**: Hover/interaction states shown

## Notes
- All features should be presented as **existing features**, not "coming soon"
- The design should feel premium and trustworthy (psychologists need to trust the tool)
- Keep it clean and professional - avoid being too playful or casual
- Focus on clarity and ease of scanning (users should quickly understand the value)
- Consider adding subtle AI-themed visual elements (circuits, nodes, data visualization patterns) but keep them minimal

## Key Message
"ClinicSense is the complete AI-powered platform that helps psychologists save time, reduce risk, and improve outcomes - all in one integrated solution."
